# islamopedia-books
This is a helper repository of [Islamopedia](https://github.com/segullshairbutt/islamopedia/) to keep the backup of the books in plain text format. 

## Contribution workflow
A new PR should be created against the work's small unit (as much as possible). It can be one page of the book, a book chapter, or a group of chapters. But the smaller the PR, the easier to review.
